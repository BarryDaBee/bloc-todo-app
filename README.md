# bloc_todo_list

A simple todo app built using bloc architecture and state management

## Purpose of this app
* To demonstrate the implementation of bloc pattern using:
  * BlocListener<Event, State>()
  * BlocBuilder<Event, State>()
  * BlocProvider<Event, State>()
  * BlocObserver<Event, State>()
  * and Cubit<State>
  
* Implementation of a less complex bloc architecture to enable easy maintenance by any other developer

## Challenges encountered
* None, really
> Bloc seems very intuitive. 
> 1. Event goes in, State comes out.
> 2. Listen to state and update UI accordingly
